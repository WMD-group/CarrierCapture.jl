# Summary
A set of codes to compute carrier capture and recombination rates in semiconducting compounds. 
This topic has a rich history starting from the work by Huang and Rhys. [@Huang:1950fg] 
Our implementation was inspired by the approach employed by Alkauskas and coworkers, [@Alkauskas:2014kk] 
but has been adapted to also describe anharmonic potential energy surfaces.
