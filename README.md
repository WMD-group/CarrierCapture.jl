# carriercapture

![](https://github.com/WMD-group/carriercapture/blob/master/schematics/Logo.png)

A set of codes to compute carrier capture and recombination rates in semiconducting compounds. 
This topic has a rich history starting from the work by [Huang and Rhys](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/204/1078/406.short) in 1950. 
Our implementation was inspired by the approach (and FORTRAN code) employed by [Alkauskas and coworkers](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.075202), but has been adapted
to also describe anharmonic potential energy surfaces. 

## Installation

The codes are written in [Julia](https://julialang.org), while the [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) also contain [Python](https://www.python.org), which are all assumed to be installed.

The [Brooglie](https://github.com/RedPointyJackson/Brooglie) package is used to solve the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation and can be installed by:

`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/RedPointyJackson/Brooglie")`  
`Pkg.add("Plots")`  
`Pkg.add("Arpack")`  
`Pkg.add("Polynomials")`  
`Pkg.add("CSV")`
`Pkg.add("DataFrames")`
`Pkg.add("LaTeXStrings")`
`Pkg.add("ArgParse")`
`Pkg.add("YAML")`
`Pkg.add("LsqFit")`

## Development

Development is in progress and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/WMD-group/carriercapture). 
Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/WMD-group/carriercapture/issues/) for feature requests, bug reports and more general questions. If you would like to contribute, please do so via a pull request.

## Usage

A typical usage will consist of about four steps, implemented in a series of short programs which may be run from the command line. Input for the calculations is provided in `input.yaml`.

1. Prepare a sequence of structures with displacements which interpolate between two defect states. Run single-point energy calculations on these structures, and extract the total energies. Scripts for preprocessing may be found in XXX

2. Generate configuration coordinate diagrams with polynomial fits to the data (`GetPotential.jl`). Solve these potential energy surfaces for the phonon wavefunctions for each defect.

3.  Calculate the overlap between phonons in the donor and acceptor potentials to give the capture coefficient for a given temperature range (`GetRate.jl`)

4. Calculate the lifetimes and rates for a given defect 

## Theory

The capture of electrons or holes by point defects in a crystalline materials requires the consideration of a number of factors, which include:

## Limitations

The expected use case for this code is to ... 

## Examples

The following examples are provided to illustrate some of the applications of these codes:

* GaAs defect (./example_GaAs) 


### Electronic matrix elements

## TODO

Using [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl) rather than Brooglie
