# POTENTIAL INPUT


# potential:	potentials from files (e.g. Potential_1.csv and Potential_2.csv). Each potential is read from a file with Q and E in columns 1 and 2 respectively. 
# poly_order:   order of the polynomial that you'd like to use to fit your potential data
# nev: 		the number of energy levels to be solved for the potentials. 
# E0: 		energy offset of potential minimum [eV]
# p0: 		initial guesses for coefficients for fitting 
#		for polynomial, must have poly_order + 1 entries 
#		for Morse potential, must have 4 entries: De, a, minimum(Q), De + E0. 
#		De is the height of the potential on the shallow side, 'a' is the narrowness of the potential, 
#		minimum(Q) is the position of the minimum of the potential and De + E0 is the value of the minimum energy of the potential
