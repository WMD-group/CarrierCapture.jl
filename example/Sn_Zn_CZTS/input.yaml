# POTENTIAL INPUT

# potential:	potentials from files (e.g. Potential_1.csv and Potential_2.csv). Each potential is read from a file with Q and E in columns 1 and 2 respectively.

# nev: 		the number of energy levels to be solved for the potentials.
# E0: 		energy offset of potential minimum [eV]
# p0: 		initial guesses for polynomial coefficients for fitting (must have poly_order + 1 entries)
