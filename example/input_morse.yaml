# Qi and Qf [amu^(1/2)*Å] define the domain over which the potentials will be solved (Q ∈ [Qi, Qf]), discretised in `NQ` steps
Qi: -2 
Qf: 40
NQ: 2000

# PLOT INPUT
# defining plot axes limits for the E vs Q (solving potentials) and the C vs 1/T (carrier capture rate vs inverse temperature) plots
plot:
    Qmin: -2
    Qmax: 40

    invTmin: 1
    invTmax: 5

# POTENTIAL INPUT

# potential:	potentials from files (e.g. Potential_1.csv and Potential_2.csv). Each potential is read from a file with Q and E in columns 1 and 2 respectively. 
# poly_order:   order of the polynomial that you'd like to use to fit your potential data
# nev: 		the number of energy levels to be solved for the potentials. 
# E0: 		energy offset of potential minimum [eV]
# p0: 		initial guesses for polynomial coefficients for fitting (must have poly_order + 1 entries)
