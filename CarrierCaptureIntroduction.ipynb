    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of codes to compute carrier capture and recombination rates in semiconducting compounds. \n",
    "This topic has a rich history starting from the work by [Huang and Rhys](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/204/1078/406.short) in 1950. \n",
    "Our implementation was inspired by the approach (and FORTRAN code) employed by [Alkauskas and coworkers](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.075202), but has been adapted\n",
    "to also describe anharmonic potential energy surfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes are written in [Julia](https://julialang.org), while the [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) also contain [Python](https://www.python.org), which are all assumed to be installed.\n",

    "The [Brooglie](https://github.com/RedPointyJackson/Brooglie) package is used to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation and can be installed by:\n",

    "\n",
    "Prepare a sequence of structures with displacements which interpolate between two defect states. Run single-point energy calculations on these structures, and extract the total energies. Once the potentials are in a txt file, a typical usage of this code will consist of about four steps, implemented in a series of short programs:\n",

    "1. Generate configuration coordinate diagrams with polynomial fits (`script here`). Solve these potential energy surfaces for the phonon wavefunctions for each defect:\n",
